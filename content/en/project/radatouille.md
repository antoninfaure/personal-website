During the course Applied Data Analysis (CS-401) at EPFL, we had to work on a data analysis project on one of the proposed datasets.
With my team (Baptiste Lecoeur, Enzo Palmisano, Jamil Maj & Mariella Daghfal) we chose to work on the CMU Movie Summary Corpus dataset.

For our datastory we decided to analyze the **user-critic divide in cinema** by comparing the ratings of movies on **IMDb** and **Metacritic**. To augment the original dataset we scraped the data from the two websites and then performed a statistical analysis on the data. We also created a website to present our results.

We employed statistical methods like T-Tests, Pearson Correlation, OLS Regression, and the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) to analyze this data. Our findings revealed interesting patterns: certain genres exhibited a larger divide in ratings, awards correlated with differences in perceptions, and the country of origin influenced movie appreciation, highlighting cultural variances in cinematic tastes.
