For the last concert of the [Fréquence Banane](https://frequencebanane.ch) 30th anniversary week of events, we pulled off a 4-meter-high trusses cube stage design in record time. With only one day before the event, we had to mount the structure, set up sound and lighting, and configure the entire light show—all in less than 24 hours (I had to pull an all-nighter to make sure the light show was ready). I used QLC+ to program the light show (as I sadly didn't have access to a grandMA2 console...).
To add to the experience, we placed two giant banana-shaped screens on each side of the stage, using them for creative video mapping throughout the event.

Here are some pictures of the stage setup:
