For the 2021 edition of the [Sysmic](https://sysmic.ch) festival, I designed a stage setup consisting of a 1.5-meter truss triangle that was suspended from the ceiling. The triangle was mounted with 2 LED strips, 4 Snowpetals and 4 SGM P-5 while beeing backlit with 3 Chauvet Freedom. The stage was used for 3 DJ sets during the festival. I used QLC+ to program the light show as it's free and I had no access to a grandMA2 console ðŸ˜”.
